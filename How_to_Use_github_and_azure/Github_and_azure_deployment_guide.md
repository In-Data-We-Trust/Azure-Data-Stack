### Making the Azure SQL DB

The standing up of the original Azure SQL DB Instance can be done in a variety of ways shown here (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?tabs=azure-powershell&view=azuresql#create-a-single-database):

* Portal or
* Azure CLI or 
* Azure CLI (Sql Up) or
* Powershell

To keep it simple, I will opt to do it all in **powershell**

They have pre-defined templates we can use, which save a **lot** of time! ðŸš€
